Program Header Generator

Author: Evan Wilde 				<etcwilde@uvic.ca>
Start Date: April 6 2014
Version: 0.1

This program will apply user templates to create uniform header documentation 
for each source file specified.
It uses the file extension to map to a given template file, 
so it can support any language.


Template Keyword Definitions:

TYPE
	Defines the type of file that this template header applies to. 
	This is case sensitive, so "C" and "c" are different file types.

---START
	Defines the start of the template that will be written to the source file.

---END
	Defines the end of the template that will be written to the source file.

<FILE>
	The name of the file with the file extensions.

<FILEPATH>
	The full file path to the file, with file extensions.

<FILENAME>
	The name of the file without file extensions.

<USERNAME>
	The name of the user who created the file.

<EMAIL>
	The email of the user who created the file.

<DATE>
	The date the file was modified. 
	If the file has never been modified, this is the creation date.

<INC>
	Where the include statements will be placed, relative to the header

INCTYPE
	How external libraries are included in a source file.
	e.g. for java it is "INCTYPE:import"
